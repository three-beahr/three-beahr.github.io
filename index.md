# Welcome to our club, welcome to our club, (welcome Squidward! welcome Squidward! welcome Squidward!...)

I'm learning Haskell! While I do love my current job, it has become apparent to me that applying my math & programming skills to the world of trading would be a real dream for me. These blog posts will serve as a little journal of my time learning about Haskell and the projects I create.
